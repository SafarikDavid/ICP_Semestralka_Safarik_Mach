# Interactive OpenGL Project (Semester Project for ICP)
## Run Project
To run directly, go to the "executable project" folder and start "ICP.exe" in it. 
(The source code itself is in the "project" folder)

## Controls

- **W, A, S, D**: Use these keys to move your character forward (W), backward (S), and sideways (A and D).
- **Mouse**: Move the mouse to adjust the camera orientation.
- **V**: Press the V key to toggle Vsync on/off.
- **M**: Press the M key to switch between windowed and fullscreen mode.
- **T**: Press the T key to toggle the flashlight tracker on/off.

## Used Libraries

- OpenGL
- GLM
- Assimp
- GLFW
- GLEW

## Project Informations
### The project contains the following features:

- Realtime 2D raster processing for tracker functionality.
- Utilization of threads for concurrent processing tasks.
- 3D graphics rendering using OpenGL (glfw+glew) with shaders and core profile.
- Mouse and keyboard input handling, with support for switching between fullscreen and windowed modes.
- Multiple moving 3D models.
- Different textures for enhanced visual appearance.
- Implementation of a lighting model with multiple lights (including 1 ambient light and other light sources).
- Handling of transparency for correct rendering.
- Implementation of collision detection to enhance interactivity and realism within the environment.

Created by David Safarik and Ondrej Mach as part of the ICP course at the Technical University of Liberec, Faculty of Mechatronics, in the academic year 2023/24.
